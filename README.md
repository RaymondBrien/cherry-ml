## Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for the Cherry Leaves project option in Predictive Analytics. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly okay to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the `Use this template` button above to get started.

You can safely delete the Template Instructions section of this README.md file and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use.

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

1. Log into your cloud IDE with your GitHub account.

1. On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button

1. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

1. Click Create

1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

1. Open a new terminal and `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory, and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the kernel button and choose Python Environments.

Note that the kernel says Python 3.8.18 as it inherits from the workspace, so it will be Python-3.8.18 as installed by our template. To confirm this, you can use `! python --version` in a notebook code cell.

## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public, then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

1. The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
2. The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

<!-- TODO List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them). -->

- We suspect leaves containing powdery mildew (from here on referred to as 'infected') will show visual and recognisable signs of the mildew, differentiating them from healthy leaves.
  - An average image study can help to uncover and investigate these differences.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

<!-- - List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks. -->

- Business Requirement 1: Data Visualisation

  - Mean-average and standard deviation representations to assess variability of images will be displayed for both infected and uninfected leaf classes (healthy or powdery mildew).
  - The differences between an average infected leaf image and an uninfected leaf image will be displayed and defined.
  - An image montage of both classes (infected and uninfected) will be collated for a clear visual representation of each class.

- Business Requirement 2: Binary Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

  - We aim to predict if a given leaf is infected or not judging by the presence of powdery mildew.
  - We aim to use the CNN to map relationships between features and labels.
  - We aim to build a binary classifier and generate reports.

## ML Business Case

### MildewClf
<!-- TODO confirm this is correct after initial data inspection -->
<!-- TODO change remove either 50x50 or 100x100 once decided  -->
- We want an ML CNN network to predict if a leaf contains powdery mildew, (indicating infection) based on historical image data. It is a supervised model, a 2-class, single-label classification model. Images will first be transformed to 100x100px (**or 50x50px**) for equal image handling.

Our ideal outcome is to provide the client with a faster and more reliable diagnostic for mildew detection.

- The model success metrics are:
  - Accuracy of 97% or above on the test set.
  - The model output is defined as a flag, indicating if the leaf displays signs of mildew and the model's calculated probability of infection.
  - Input: leaf image.
  - Output: Prediction (per image) of whether the cherry leaf is healthy or contains mildew.

- Heuristics:
The current diagnostic needs an experienced staff and detailed inspection to distinguish infected and non-infected leaves. Trees are inspected manually, with each inspection per tree averaging 30 minutes: this includes taking sample tree leaves and assessing from basic visual criteria to determine if a leaf is infected. If mildew is present, an employee will apply antifungal compounds to kill the mildew, for each tree taking c.1 minute.
This leaves room to produce inaccurate diagnostics due to human error. Furthermore, staff expertise, training and infection inspections are hugely costly for business, preventing scalable growth due to personel demands and knowledge.
The development of an effective ML model will provide scalable growth opportunities for wider varieties of crops, however, most importantly can give the client the confident ability to supply the market with products which are not of comprimised quality.

- Ethical or Privacy concerns?
The client provided the data under an NDA (non-disclosure agreement), therefore the data should only be shared with professionals that are officially involved in the project.

<!-- TODO determine total image count of dataset UPDATE after initial analysis -->
The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops. This dataset contains about **1234** thousand images. We have extracted a subset of **1234** images from this dataset and saved it to Kaggle dataset directory for quicker model training.

Train data - target: infected or not; features: all images

## Dashboard Design (Streamlit App User Interface)

<!-- TODO List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items, that your dashboard library supports. -->
<!-- TODO Finally, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project, you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight, but later, you chose another plot type). -->
